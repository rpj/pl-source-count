A source code line counter and defect estimation script in Perl, with support for most common source file types.

To add a file type, check out the $file_types variable declared at line 42. Always leave the first two zeros in the array (as shown by every other element), and then specify the comment type(s) to look for with that type of file. Easy-peasy-japanesey.
